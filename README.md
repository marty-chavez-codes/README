## Approach:

#### Overview
Description of how you approach the game development. Here you will add all the development phases, from wireframes to code sample. 

#### Wireframe

N/A (not sure how to copy/past link to draw.io...will try to share through github)

Color Pallet:

#f5f5f5;
#808080;
#40e0d0;


#### User stories

N/A

#### Development Plan 


* Development Plan  One - Did class Player and class Computer on draw.io as well as wireframe - wasn't that successful
* Development Plan  Two - No true second Dev Plan.  with game flow and general idea in mind, I kind of just went about the HTML w/ CSS to start to build out index.html
* Development Plan  Three - Dev Plan three was really about putting in logic and prompts for game in app.js
* Development Plan  Four - Dev Plan four was tweaking and fixing code.  Making adjustments and abandoning what I wasn't able to complete in the alloted time.  Have every intention of going back to complete game to 100% my original vision of game play and added features that are missing. 

#### MVP

* MVP ONE
* MVP Two
* MVP Three 
* MVP Four

#### Stretch goals

* Stretch goals One - Add quotes by Sheldor after Win or Lose scenario.
* Stretch goals Two
* Stretch goals Three 
* Stretch goals Four

## Challenges:

Was unsuccessful in getting score for each player to update.  I believe it's a scoping issue and that's where I'll begin debugging. In order to present project i commented out player scores and 'best of five' indicator.
